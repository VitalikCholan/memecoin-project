- Website which represents the token.

## Technologies

- Solidity: writing the token contract and the faucet contract.
- OpenZeppelin: using the OpenZeppelin library for the token contract and the faucet contract.
- Hardhat: writing the deployment script and the tests.
- Angular: writing the website.
- TypeScript: writing the website.
- Ethers.js: interacting with the blockchain.
- Vercel: deploying the website.
